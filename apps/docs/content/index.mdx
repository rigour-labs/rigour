## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize Rigour in your project
npx @rigour-labs/cli init

# Run your agent inside a quality loop
npx @rigour-labs/cli run -- claude "Refactor the auth service"
```

## 🏁 The Rigour Loop

1. **Check**: Verify compliance with project standards.
2. **Analyze**: Identify violations and generate structured diagnostics.
3. **Refactor**: AI agents apply fixes based on specific instructions.
4. **Repeat**: Loop until the quality gates return **PASS**.
