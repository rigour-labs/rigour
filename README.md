**Local-first quality gates for AI-generated code.**  
Rigour forces AI agents to meet strict engineering standards before marking tasks "Done".

> **Zero cloud. Zero telemetry. PASS/FAIL is always free.**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npx @rigour-labs/cli init     # Initialize quality gates
npx @rigour-labs/cli check    # Verify code quality
npx @rigour-labs/cli run -- claude "Build feature X"  # Agent loop
```

### 🛑 The "Vibe Coding" Trap

AI agents often fall into a cycle of **"Guess and Hope"**:
1. Agent makes a change.
2. Agent **claims** "Task 100% complete" or "CI will pass now."
3. Agent **pushes** to remote.
4. **CI Fails** (Type error, lint failure, broken test).

This is "Vibe Coding"—the agent is hallucinating success based on narrative, not execution.

**Rigour breaks this cycle.** It forces the agent to face the same cold, hard verification tools (ruff, mypy, vitest) that CI runs, but **locally and immediately.** Rigour turns a "claim of victory" into a "proof of execution."

## 🔄 How It Works

```
Agent writes code → Rigour checks → FAIL? → Fix Packet → Agent retries → PASS ✓
```

The `rigour run` command loops until your agent achieves PASS or hits max iterations.

## ⚙️ What Gets Checked

| Gate | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **File Size** | Max lines per file (default: 300-500) |
| **Hygiene** | No TODO/FIXME comments allowed |
| **Complexity** | Cyclomatic complexity limits (AST-based) |
| **Required Docs** | SPEC.md, ARCH.md, README must exist |
| **Safety Rails** | Protected paths, max files changed |
| **Context Alignment** | Prevents drift by anchoring on project patterns |

---

## 🤖 Works With

- **Claude Code**: `rigour run -- claude "..."`
- **Cursor / Cline / Gemini**: Via high-fidelity MCP server (`rigour_check`, `rigour_explain`)
